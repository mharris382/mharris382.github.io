I am a passionate and dedicated game developer with a strong desire to help bring powerful interactive experiences to light. 

As an experienced programmer, I've delved into the intricacies of game mechanics, procedural content generation, and AI. For every project I work on, I always strive to achieve efficiency not only for my own work, but for the artists, writers, and designers I am working with. I am keen on developing tools that make my life easier and help other teammates do their jobs better as well, with the overall goal being to make the end result better.

{% include feature_row %}

I have been independently exploring the realms of game development and software engineering since 2016. My experience in game development has come from a variety of game jams, personal projects, and an internship working with Unity and Unreal Engine.


I am a passionate programmer with a passion for game development. In addition to programming, I have skills as a designer and technical artist. Whatever project I am working on, I am focused on making it the best possible product while simultaneously considering efficiency, resources, and time managment. I would often time prefer creative solutions that achieve the best possible result, rather than always take the obvious easy path. I will always share my opinions and thoughts, but I am equally flexible about the ideas the team chooses to pursue. I respect other's opinions and differences, and try my best to communicate and collaborate at the highest possible level no matter what.

In addition to building features and mechanics. I can create tools to be used by designers and artists, increasing their efficiency and producing the highest quality result we want to see. I also host teaching and onboarding sessions and record training videos for other teammembers.

I have an extreme respect for good software architecture. I understand the principles of good software, and while I do agknolwdge that at times sacrifices must be made, I try my best to maintain the codebase and project as it scales. I also try to consider the that what I write may need to work in unexpected ways, and while I usually won't build abstractions at the start, I will keep them in mind as the project develops. I also know that while refactoring is not always as fun, it is incredibly valuable and must be done sometimes to ensure the best result is achieved.

I believe I would be a valuable asset on many types of projects, but I am especially attracted to more ambitious projects. I want to make software that pushes the boundaries of technology and delivers incredible experiences. Throughout my journey in game development I have learned everything I can to reach a level where those kind of experiences are a feasible goal. 

Finally, I am always fully committed to continuous learning. As I tackle new kinds of challenges and new technologies are created, I will dive headfirst into learning new skills and techniques so that the project can be the best it can be.
