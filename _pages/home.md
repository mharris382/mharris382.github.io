I began my game development journey in 2016. My work has evolved from simple independent projects to group projects for game jams.

As an experienced programmer, I've delved into the intricacies of game mechanics, procedural content generation, and AI. For every project I work on, I always strive to achieve efficiency not only for my own work, but for the artists, writers, and designers I am working with. I am keen on developing tools that make my life easier and help other teammates do their jobs better as well, with the overall goal being to make the end result better.

I am competent and passionate about many areas of game development and software development. This makes me quite a versatile member of any team, as I am able to wear several hats if need be. I have a passion for physics, graphics, databases, procedural generation, and AI.

I am a passionate and dedicated game developer with a strong desire to help bring powerful interactive experiences to light. I am currently completing a degree in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Springfield. I have been independently exploring the realms of game development and software engineering since 2016. 

My experience in game development has come from a variety of game jams, personal projects and an internship working with Unity and Unreal Engine.
